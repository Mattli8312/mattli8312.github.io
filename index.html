            Hi! I'm Matthew Lian. I was born and raised in New York and moved to the greater

            I had the opportunity of working with a lot of talented developers and design new features enhancing workflow experiences
            for perioperative nurses. I primarily worked with typescript and React, developing features using the .NET framework.

            I'm a huge anime nerd. Recently I started watching One Piece (probably won't finish anytime soon). 
            Some of my favorite shows include Jujutsu Kaisen, Kaiju No 8, One Punch Man, and AoT. I've also seen 
            other shows including WindBreaker, Haikyuu, Demon Slayer, and a bunch of other shonens. I could go on for 
            hours about the different anime I've seen.
        </div>
        <div class="contentblock">
            I also love live action TV shows as well, some of my favorite being Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, 
            the Last of Us and White Lotus. If you want to know more about some of my other favorites, check out 
            my blog to see more :)

        <div class="contentblock">
            I mainly watched basketball and football growing up, more basketball though but love both sports.
            My favorite team is the Knicks, I'm a big Jalen Brunson fan. If not the Knicks, I also love the Bulls, 
            despite a lot of the star players leaving :(. My favorite Football team is the Chiefs since I'm a big fan
            of Patrick Maholmes. I'm trying to get into basketball again since I haven't been
            keeping up with it as much as I wanted and also Football since I've never watched as many games outside of
            the superbowl.

        <div class="contentblock">
            In College I played a lot of Call of Duty since my roommate had a PS4 and PS3 and we would stay up 
            late nights playing black ops zombies. Black ops 2 is the best, fight me (don't actually plz I'll lose)
            since I'm a sucker for nostalgia and every weapon and map is iconic. I'm trying to play more PC games 
            as well and switch games since I mainly play whatever's trending like Minecraft and League. 
            Plan on getting into Black Myth Wukong, the Last of Us, and Zelda Breath of the Wild. I also
            need to get into Baldur's Gate but there's a ton of games I've been meaning to play.
